mixins
Use CompositionAPI, NO for mixin.

This directory is for organizing all your Vue.js mixins. I think it's important to still append the word Mixin to the end of every file name (like ResourceTableMixin.js) for easy searching in your file switcher. Though I haven't had the chance to really work on a larger scale Vue 3 project yet, I assume this will probably quickly change to a composables directory in preference of extracting reactive data/methods with the Composition API instead of with mixins. Or at least a composables directory might be added to my standard file structure in addition to the mixins directory.
