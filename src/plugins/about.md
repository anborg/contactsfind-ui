plugins

The last directory I like to include for all my Vue projects is the plugins directory. In a world of packages and libraries we sometimes end up doing more configuring and registering than we do actual coding. That's what this directory is for, including and setting up all the third party Vue stuff. While it's called plugins I don't always necessarily use the term in the strictest sense. In other words, it doesn't have be a third party lib registered via the Vue .use() method. Often times it is, but other times it uses alternate methods of setting up the lib with Vue (such as .component()). For libs that take a one or 2 line setup, I'll write it in a plugins/index.js file. For those that take a more involved setup, I like to create a dedicated file for them in the plugins directory and then import it into the plugins/index.js.
